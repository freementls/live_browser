bringing the internet to life

Requires https://github.com/freementls/LOM

I'm fixing the internet. Shoutout to Linus Torvalds. Computers use death-based logic instead of life-based principles. Bridging this gap is non-trivial but inevitable. I'd prefer if we could keep our advances instead of only removing our losses, civilizationally. 

Having a chat that can work across websites instead of being centralized to one company or web adress etc. is about a week's worth of work away.

Fractality, universal harmony, inverflexion.
